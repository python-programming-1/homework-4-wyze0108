# Homework 4

# Let's Make A Game! 
## Can you make rock paper scissors?

For this assignment you'll make a rock paper scissors game!

1. git clone this repository like you did in homework 2 and 3
2. create a file named rock_paper_scissors.py inside your repository (repo) folder on your machine.
3. When you run your program, it should prompt the user by printing "make a move! (r/s/p):"
4. Your program should accept 6 inputs from a user: 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, 's' for scissors and 'y' for yes and 'n' for no, 'sc' for score.
5. Your program should randomly select a move. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html for reference.
5. Your program should output the following line with one of the options (rock, paper, scissors) for the computer and yourself:
'You chose rock/paper/scissors and the computer chose rock/paper/scissors. You Win/Lose!
6. After a game, the computer should ask you 'Do you want to play again? (y/n)?' If you enter 'y' the game should start over, if you enter 'n' the program should exit after saying "thanks bye!".
7. If a player inputs 'sc' return a score like: 'human: X, computer: Y' where X and Y are the respective scores.
8. Bonus: Can you make the computer smarter? Instead of a random move, have the computer make a move based on the player's history of moves.
So if the player has played scissor three times, the computer may try to play rock.

Sample output:

    >>Make a move! (r/s/p)
    r
    >> You chose rock and the computer chose scissors. You win!
    sc
    >> human: 1, computer: 0
    >> Do you want to play again? (y/n)
    n
    >>Thanks bye!

9. Follow the instructions as precisely as possible, but feel free to ask me for clarification. You'll want to use loops like a while loop to repeat certain instructions, like asking a user to play again, and if/else statements to help your program handle the different possible outcomes that your game of rock paper scissors may generate. You may use a list or some other data structure to store the history of player moves for #8.
